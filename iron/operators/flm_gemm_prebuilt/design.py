"""Runtime sequence for the prebuilt FastFlowLM ``mm`` overlay.

The overlay ships as a binary xclbin, so this module emits only the host-side
half of a dispatch: the shim DMA transfers and the runtime parameters. Every
core program, memtile buffer and stream-switch route comes from the xclbin.

Three properties of the overlay set what this sequence must do, and none of
them are visible in the xclbin:

  * **The cores read their shape from runtime parameters.** One overlay serves
    every GEMM in a model, so ``K/K_TILE``, ``M`` and ``N``, the activation
    and the clamp all arrive as words in each core's data memory. A core
    blocks on :data:`RTP_LOCK_ID` until the sequence releases it, so a
    dispatch that writes no parameters hangs.
  * **The shim channel map is fixed.** A arrives on MM2S channel 0 of columns
    0, 2, 4 and 6; B on MM2S channel 1 of every column; C leaves on S2MM
    channel 0 of every column. The allocations below reproduce that map.
  * **B arrives pre-packed**, in the order :meth:`FLMGEMM.pack_B` produces.

``iron.operators.flm_gemm`` is a port of this overlay, so the two agree on
tiling, on the byte order of each transfer and on the packed B layout. Its
own instruction stream still cannot drive this xclbin: it writes no runtime
parameters, and its lowering puts B on MM2S channel 0 in the odd columns.
