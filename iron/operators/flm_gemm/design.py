"""bf16 GEMM over a fixed 4x8 compute-tile grid.

This is a different design from ``iron.operators.gemm``, not a retuning of it.
The distinguishing choices, all of which the kernel's L1 layout depends on:

  * **A is broadcast along each compute row.** Four shim tiles (columns 0/2/4/6)
    each feed one row of the grid, and every one of the 8 tiles in that row
    consumes the same A object. B is broadcast down each column. So an A tile is
    fetched once per row rather than once per tile.
  * **C is joined at the memtile.** Each of the 4 tiles in a column writes its
    own 64x128 slice into one memtile buffer, which drains to DDR as a single
    256x128 block, rather than each tile draining separately.
  * **The mmul keeps A in a single ObjectFifo object** spanning every z slice
    (``flm_gemm_mmul.h``), instead of a ping/pong pair the kernel locks itself.
  * **The epilogue is fused**: the f32->bf16 conversion, an optional activation
    and an optional clamp all happen while the values are still in registers,
    on the way into the C object.

Geometry is fixed (m/k/n = 64/512/128, r/s/t = 8/8/8, 4x8 grid). The constants
below are the single source of truth: ``op.py`` passes them to the kernels as
-D flags, so the C++ and the dataflow cannot drift apart.

    # Note the gap between that 604 us of floor and the 137 us actually
    # captured: repeat_count restarts the memtile BD chain at every replay
    # boundary, and ~77% of the win goes there. Closing it is the largest known
    # remaining lever on this design. Do not measure it at small M -- at M=512
    # the effect is inside the noise, which is how it was first mistaken for a
    # power-only optimisation.

    # One object, not k_iters of them: iterating a pool replays each object in
    # turn (k0,k0,k1,k1,...) rather than the sequence. Fitting k into the

    # outermost dim already steps by (N_TILE//T)*(K_TILE*T), exactly
    # K_TILE*N_TILE, so widening its COUNT walks into the next k-block;
    # outbound k becomes a new outermost dim, which also keeps one emitted
    # object per CT_MAX_K slice.
