"""bf16 GEMM over a 4-row compute-tile grid, as wide as the device.

A second GEMM design alongside ``iron.operators.gemm``, specialised for
transformer projection shapes. The overall dataflow is the same whole-array
shape as that operator's -- A broadcast along each compute row, B down each
column, C joined through the memtile -- so those are NOT what distinguishes it.
What does:

  * **Fixed tiling.** m/k/n = 64/512/128 and r/s/t = 8/8/8, rather than
    parameterised tiles. Only the grid WIDTH varies with the device: 8 columns
    on NPU2, 4 on NPU1.
  * **A fused epilogue.** The f32->bf16 conversion, an optional activation and
    an optional clamp all happen while the values are still in registers, on the
    way into the C object, instead of a separate pass over L1.
  * **B arrives pre-packed** by ``GEMM.pack_B``, in the order the cores consume
    it, so both B hops are plain linear descriptors. On NPU2 it is also
    quantized to bfp16ebs8.
  * **Asymmetric tile buffering**, so the A tile and the accumulator need not
    share a height.

The constants below are the single source of truth: ``op.py`` passes them to the
kernels as -D flags, so the C++ and the dataflow cannot drift apart.

r/s/t stays 8/8/8 on both architectures. AIE2's native bf16 mac is 4x8x4, but
``aie::mmul<8,8,8>`` decomposes onto it as exactly four native macs with no
wasted lanes, so the whole blocked L1 layout -- ``pack_B``, the four stream
dimension lists below, and ``gather_dims`` -- is shared verbatim. Only AIE2P has
the bfp16-emulated path that does the same shape in two macs, which is why
``op.py`` passes ``AIE_API_EMULATE_BFLOAT16_MMUL_WITH_BFP16`` there and not here.

# kernel as -DMM_FUSED_CT_K, making this table the only place it is decided.
# n=256 is deliberately absent: at that width the f32 accumulator alone
# (M_TILE * 256 * 4 = 65536 bytes) already fills the whole of L1, before A, B

#
# Matching AIE2's native 4x8x4 mac shape instead is a measured dead end, at
# 22-30% slower: the kernel is load-port bound rather than shuffle bound, and
# 4/8/4 needs 1.62 loads per mac against 8/8/8's 1.06, because the 2x2 register
# block amortizes each load over four macs either way but over far less work.

    # scale with m_row_blocks. Larger K does not fit and falls back to
    # re-reading. See README.md for the measured effect.
    #
    # Three things here are load-bearing rather than tuning:
    #
    #   * ONE object spanning every k-block, not a pool of k_iters objects.
    #     Iterating a pool replays each object in turn (k0,k0,k1,k1,...) rather
    #     than the k0..kn sequence the cores accumulate in.
    #   * repeat_count on the forward() below is what re-sends an object.
    #     iter_count only bounds how many times an end cycles through all its
    #     buffers, so it is in units of depth-cycles; getting it wrong hangs
    #     rather than mis-computing.
    #   * The depth search takes the deepest that fits, not depth 1. Single
    #     buffering stops the next column-block prefetching behind this one's
    #     replay, which measures worse than not being resident at all.
    #
    # The budget must count what A and C actually occupy: at tile_n=128 C
    # doubles and a resident B is 432 KB, and a budget that assumed C's size
    # admitted a configuration that then failed address assignment. Placement
    # has zero slack -- the eight memtiles pack to exactly 512 KB, relying on
    # aie-objectfifo-allocate spilling one buffer to an adjacent tile -- so
    # re-verify it after any change to the A, B or C buffer sizes.
    # B residency is gone: it sizes the memtile buffer from k_iters and
    # replays it m_row_blocks times through the forward()'s repeat_count, so
    # it carries both K and M into the configuration, which is what the
    # runtime parameters exist to remove. See README.md for what that cost.
