"""Weight packing shared by the FastFlowLM-derived operators.

Both ``flm.GEMM`` and ``flm.MMPrebuilt`` consume B pre-packed into the order
the compute tiles read it, so their B transfers are plain linear descriptors.
The reorder is deliberately the caller's job: expressing it as a strided
descriptor over an unpacked B leaves an innermost run of ``t`` bf16 values, so
each transfer becomes thousands of scattered bursts -- measured 5.4x slower end
to end. Weights are packed once and reused across dispatches, so the cost
belongs here.

    """Reorder a row-major ``(K, N)`` weight matrix into consumption order.

    ``s``/``t`` are the mmul's register tiling and ``ct_k`` the k slice one
    compute tile holds at a time; all three set the blocked layout, and packing
    with the wrong value produces a wrongly ordered buffer of the RIGHT SIZE, so
    it mis-computes silently rather than raising.

    With ``bfp16`` the result is a flat uint8 tensor of bfp16ebs8 blocks (9
    bytes per 8 values); otherwise a flat bf16 tensor. The quantization is not a
    loss this adds: the AIE2P mmul only multiplies bfp16, so the bf16 path would
    convert B inside every mac anyway. Doing it here hoists a rounding that
    already happened, and makes B 9 bytes per 8 values instead of 16.
    ``round_conv_even`` rounds the mantissas to nearest, ties to even, as a
    core does after ``set_rounding(conv_even)``. Otherwise they round toward
    minus infinity, the cores' power-up mode.

    ``overlay_order`` swaps the two within-block k axes (``i`` and ``s_in``
    below). It exists solely for :class:`iron.operators.flm.MMPrebuilt`, whose
    B stream is read by FastFlowLM's shipped ``mm.xclbin``, not by a kernel
    built here: that overlay's own loop nest sweeps ``s_in`` outer and ``i``
    inner, the reverse of ``mm_fused_mmul_2x2``'s ``i``-outer loop. The
    now-deleted ``flm_pack_B`` (see ``bench_vs_flm.py`` history) verified this
    ordering against the overlay via ``tile.reshape(...).transpose(2, 1, 0,
    3)``; incompatible with ``bfp16``, which only the IRON-built kernel uses.
